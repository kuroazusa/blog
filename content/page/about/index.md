Hi, I'm Crepvéant, a middle school student passionate about freedom, music, and programming. Exploring the infinite possibilities of the world.

I go by many internet identities—some are secret, but here's what I can share 😈:

- **Crepvéant Zeng**: My English name in real life. 
  *Fun fact—my parents once called me “Wynn” since a trip to Macau, but I’m not a fan of casinos, so I decided to stick with Crepvéant.*
- **Kurokawa Azusa (黒川 梓)**: My Japanese name, which I use for my [private GitHub account](https://github.com/kuroazusa).

Born and raised in Beijing. That said, please follow the UTC+8 normal human routine when contacting me—I do need my sleep! 💤

I have a soft spot for warm, fluffy, and cute things, which is why I believe that [<i>~~TECH OTAKUS SAVE THE WORLD!~~</i>](https://www.mihoyo.com/en) technology will make life even cozier. 🐾

**Fanatic (and slightly extreme) Apple fan**, currently use iPhone Xs Max & MacBook Pro Early 2013.

Preparing for the CHSEE (China High School Entrance Exam) and working **LAZY** to get into the International Department right now.
