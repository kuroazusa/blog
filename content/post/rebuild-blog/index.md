In short, my blog has *blown up* yet again. 

And here I am, only now finally getting around to restoring it. Sticking with **hugo-theme-stack**, shoutout to CaiJimmy for the beautiful theme. 

Is this a blessing in disguise? Maybe? Because hey, Iâ€™ve been leveling up my tech. My personal homepage is now rocking `Preact` and `framer-motion`, with a fresh style upgrade to boot. 

But guess what? All my previous posts? Gone. Poof. Vanished.  
Thanks to *that* service provider. I renewed it on the last possible day, but nope, they still managed to screw me over. Totally their fault. ðŸ˜¡

So this time, Iâ€™m taking no chancesâ€”deploying everything on GitHub. As long as GitHub doesnâ€™t implode, my blog will stay intact. Fingers crossed.

Alright then, back to square one. 

Let's start fresh.
